<p align='justify'>A global pandemic of a novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared by the World Health Organization in March 2020. This viral outbreak, originating in Wuhan, China in 2019, has spurred the development of novel AI-powered diagnostic approaches for COVID-19. However, these tools are often hampered by significant false-negative rates, potentially jeopardizing patient outcomes. To address this critical challenge, we present a study on a COVID-19 severity recognition model that leverages a combination of 2,500 multimodal data points and an Early Fusion Type-I (EFT1) architecture. Two automated systems were implemented to facilitate machine learning algorithm comparison and feature selection. The Descended Composite Scores Average (DCSA) method served as the performance evaluation metric. The Extreme Gradient Boost algorithm achieved the highest DCSA score (0.998) within the AutoCML system, while the Random Forest algorithm outperformed others in the AutoIFSCML system (DCSA score: 0.960). These findings demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned machine-learning models to enhance diagnostic accuracy in COVID-19. Additionally, the study underscores the efficacy of ensemble learning in boosting the performance of traditional models.</p>
